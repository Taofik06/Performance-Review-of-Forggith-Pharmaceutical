# Sales Performance Report
Forggith's sales performance has been robust. With a total revenue of €11.12 billion, they have surpassed their overall target of €8.45 billion by 32% for the 4 years considered. On an annual level, the company has consistently surpased their target of *€2 billion*, showcasing growth and achievement.
- Growth Pattern: The revenue consistently grew from 2022 to 2024 but saw a little decline in 2025 comapred to previous even though the target was also surpased. The dip might, such occurrences could result from various factors like market saturation, increased competition, economic factors, or other external influences.

Revenue vs. Target: Despite the YoY changes, FORGGITH managed to consistently surpass its annual revenue targets over the four years. This indicates effective sales strategies and strong market demand for their products.

Sub-channels: Retail emerged as the dominant sub-channel for revenue generation across all four years, suggesting a robust consumer base. However, the Government, Institution, and Private channels also brought substantial contributions.

Product Classes: While the leading product class varied between Antiseptics and Analgesics over the years, the overall product strategy seems to be working given the consistent performance across categories.
